this repository represent a course work in the subject RMPC

Problem statement:
this project's main goal is to achieve path planning, trajectory planning, and motion control for Franka Emika 7DoF robotic manipulator with static obstacles avoidance using different algorithms (PF, RRT_connect, RRT*, RL) for path planning, (joint space interpolation) for trajectory planning, and finally computed torque controller as a motion controller.

**Path Planning Algorithms: **
The path planning of robotic arms in complex and narrow environments with multiple obstacles poses challenges, and path-planning algorithms can generally be categorized into three types: graph-based search, deep learning-based, and sampling-based algorithms.
