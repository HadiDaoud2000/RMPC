this repository represent a course work in the subject RMPC

Problem statement:
this project's main goal is to achieve path planning, trajectory planning, and motion control for Franka Emika 7DoF robotic manipulator with static obstacles avoidance using different algorithms (PF, RRT_connect, RRT*) for path planning, (joint space interpolation) for trajectory planning, and finally computed torque controller as a motion controller.
